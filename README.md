### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm Charles and I'm a computer science student at UT Dallas.<br>
I graduate with a BS this December 2021 and a MSCS next summer 2022.</p>

FWIW: Here's my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesdungy/

These are the latest personal projects I am working on and thinking about.<br>
I like to work on things that overlap between software engineering and data science.

<br>

> ### NYC Service Requests Pipeline & Dashboard
> [Repository Link](https://github.com/charlesdungy/nyc-service-requests-pipeline)
> - The goal of this project is to highlight details about NYC service requests.
> - Data is requested from the NYC Open Data API, which is then placed into a MongoDB data lake.
> - Then data is transformed and loaded into a MySQL database, after which Tableau queries to create a dashboard.

> ### New to Netflix Data Scraper & Pipeline
> [Repository Link](https://github.com/charlesdungy/new-to-streaming-scraper)
> - The goal of this project is to show new titles streaming on Netflix along with their details, like ratings and Rotten Tomatoes' scores.
> - Data is scraped from whats-on-netflix.com and rottentomatoes.com, which is then transformed and cleaned with R or Python.
> - Next the data is placed into a MySQL database and R is used to query and visualize the results, which I am testing here: https://charlesdungy.github.io/new-to-streaming-scraper/
